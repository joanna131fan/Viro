# An Evaluation of the Costs of a Viral Pandemic inspired by Covid-19 

Over the last decade, an intensive effort has been undertaken to develop global surveillance networks that combat pandemics of emergent infectious diseases. To better understand the spread of a specific virus, computational models have been created. In contemporary mathematical epidemiology, agent-based modeling (ABM) represents the state-of-the-art for simulating complex epidemic systems. Taking into account transportation infrastructure of the simulated area, the mobility of the population, and evolutionary aspects of the disease, ABMs are by nature a “brute force” method that details a bottom-up stochastic approach to approximating the dynamics of real-world cases, i.e. individual-level behaviors define system-level results. To mirror the 2020 coronavirus outbreak, a non-linear network structure similar to a SIR mathematical model is applied. Then, a step further is taken to connect the outbreak with its economic implications in a medical cost-effectiveness analysis. In this study, the agent-based model is utilized to model the epidemiological and economic implications of viral pandemics, specifically the SARS-cov-2 virus.


## SIR_Version
#### Uses mesa_SIR to plot and interpret the epidemiological implications of viral infection.

## Visual_Version
#### Uses mesa to create a network visualization agent-based model with user-settable parameters to accomodate any general infection.

## Installing Mesa
``` $ pip install mesa```

## Running Visual Version
```$ python model_viz.py```
